# Frontend Mentor - Blogr landing page

This is a solution to the [Blogr landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blogr-landing-page-EX2RLAApP).

The site is built desktop first and fully responsive for all screens.
I used Sass, and Vanilla JS only for the mobile menu.
The layout is done using mostly flexbox, with grid only for the footer.
